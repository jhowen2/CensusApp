## Midterm.
  
#### 1.  Map the delay by destination.
  
  Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Hereâ€™s an easy way to draw a map of the United States.  You are welcome to use this code or some other code. 

```{r} 
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

airports %>%
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()
```

You might want to use the size or colour of the points to display the average delay for each airport.

```{r}

flights
planes
airlines
airports
weather

#flights%>%
  #left_join(airports, by )
  #group_by(dest, na.rm = F)%>%
  #summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay), na.rm = F)
  #ggplot(mapping = aes(x = dest, y = delay)) + 
  #geom_point()

# put your answer here.
# flights %>%
#   group_by(dest)%>%
#   summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay), na.rm = T,
#             destination = dest)%>%
#   ggplot(mapping = aes(x = destination, y = delay)) +
#   geom_line()

# flights %>% 
#   filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay)) %>% 
#   group_by(tailnum) %>% 
#   summarise(
#     delay = mean(arr_delay)
#   ) %>% 
#   ggplot(mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
#   geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)


flights2 = flights%>%
  group_by(dest)%>%
  summarize(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T))

airports%>%
  left_join(flights2, c("faa" = "dest"))%>%
  filter(complete.cases(mean_delay))%>%
  ggplot(aes(lon,lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point(aes(col = mean_delay)) +
  coord_quickmap()
```


#### 2.   Do planes trade ownership?

You might expect that thereâ€™s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Explore this conjecture using data. (Let's assume that the tail number of a plane does not change.)

```{r}
flights%>%
  group_by(tailnum, carrier)%>%
  summarize(n = n())%>%
  group_by(tailnum)%>%
  summarize(n = n())%>%
  filter(n > 1)
  
```


#### 3a.  Plane's average speed.

Notice that ```flights$air_time``` is in minutes.  Make a new column that is the air time in hours. 

```{r}
flights%>%
  mutate(air_time_hours = (air_time %/% 60) + ((air_time %% 60) / 60))
```


#### 3b. Average speed

For each flight, compute the average speed of that flight (in miles per hour).  Then, for each plane, compute the average of those average speeds. Display it in a histogram. You can use a base R histogram ```hist``` or ggplot's ```geom_histogram```. 

```{r}
flights%>%
  mutate(air_time_hours = (air_time %/% 60) + ((air_time %% 60) / 60),
         mph = distance / air_time_hours)%>%
  group_by(tailnum)%>%
  summarize(mean_mph = mean(mph), na.rm = F)%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = mean_mph)) +
  geom_histogram()
```




#### 5. Bonus

Make a table where each row is a destination, each column is a carrier, and each element is the number of times that the carrier has flown to that destination.  Ensure that you only count flights that arrived at the destination. 

```{r}
flights%>%
  filter(complete.cases(arr_time))%>%
  group_by(carrier, dest)%>%
  summarize(n = n())%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = dest, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% View
```
